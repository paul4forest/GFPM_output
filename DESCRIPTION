Description: The system converts raw GFPM output (text files .DAT) into dataframes.
    So that you can avoid using Excel macros to display GFPM simulations. 
    Based on the converted data, several reports can be generated in the form of html, 
    pdf or Excel documents. It can be used to plot consumption, production and
    trade volumes for more than 2 scenarios and to automate various calculations 
    such as welfare and value added.
